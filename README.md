|[Analysis of Land in Magic: The Gathering Decks](https://github.com/richardtguy/colab/blob/main/MtG_deck_analysis.ipynb)|Monte Carlo simulation of drawing cards in games of Magic: The Gathering, to investigate the optimal number of lands to draft for single and multi-coloured decks.  Key findings include the low probability of being able to play cards of a minor colour (i.e. the deck contains less than around 20% lands of that type) in the early to mid-game, if they include two coloured mana in their casting cost.|
